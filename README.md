Wine quality datasets



In this project, we have used the wine quality data sets available from the UCI machine learning repository. The source of these data sets is Paulo Cortez from University of Minho, Guimarães, Portugal (http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez).



The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available in these datasets.



Dataset attribute information:



Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol



Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)



Proposal:

In our project, we are going to find the three top input variables that affect the wine quality for both the red and white wines. We will use a decision tree analysis for the physicochemical data (as inputs) and the wine quality (as the output) to determine the three top predictors. The three top predictors will be the closest rule stumps to the tree root. We will do this analysis on both the red and wine datasets.
